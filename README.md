Phase 2 Assessment - Mini Twitter!
------------------------------------

For your assessment today we'll be building our own mini version of Twitter.

The requirements for this assignment are in the form of [User Stories](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story)

There is a lot here. DO NOT FREAK OUT. You will be graded on the quality of your work, not the quantity.

Plan what is needed to provide the experience for each User Story and execute it. Execute each user story sequentially from top to bottom.

Good luck and feel free to ask questions for clarity.

####User Stories

As a user, I can register for an account and sign in.

As a user, I can make posts that appear on my personal page.

As a user, I can tag my posts with keywords in the form of hashtags. (ie: #fashion, #belieber)

As a user, I can search for hashtags and get a list of posts with those hashtags sorted by created date starting with the most recently created.

As a user, I can click a repost button on posts by others and automatically post it to my personal page. The page should not reload when I click the repost button,

As a user, I would like a clean and approachable interface.
